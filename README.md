# GOV.UK Vue Docs

This is the documentation for [GOV.UK Vue](https://github.com/govuk-vue/govuk-vue). It's built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

Components in GOV.UK Vue are parsed with [vue-docgen](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/docgen-cli.html) to extract props and slots.

Component documentation is in `content/2.components`. Vue component examples are converted to SFC `.vue` files by 
`server/plugins/content.ts`. This allows us to show a rendered version of the example, as well as the code.

Documentation is generated by running `npm run generate`. This generates static files.
