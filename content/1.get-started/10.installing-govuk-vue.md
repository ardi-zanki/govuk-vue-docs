# Installing GOV.UK Vue

## Before you start

GOV.UK Vue is compatible with Vue 3.2.47 and up.

You'll need a Vue project to add GOV.UK Vue to. The easiest way to create a Vue project is using
[create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).

GOV.UK Vue works with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). If you're using Nuxt, see
[Using GOV.UK Vue with Nuxt](/get-started/using-govuk-vue-with-nuxt) instead of these instructions.

## Install GOV.UK Vue

Install GOV.UK Vue from npm:

```sh
npm install govuk-vue
```

GOV.UK Vue is a [plugin](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins.html), so add it to your Vue app with `.use()`.

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { GovUkVue } from 'govuk-vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.use(GovUkVue)
```

## Install GOV.UK Frontend

GOV.UK Vue relies on CSS from GOV.UK Frontend. You may already be using GOV.UK Frontend if you're adding GOV.UK Vue
to an existing server-rendered project. If so, you can skip this step.

If it's not already included in your project, install Sass:

```sh
npm install sass --save-dev
```

Install GOV.UK Frontend:

```sh
npm install govuk-frontend --save-dev
```

Import the main Sass file into your app's main Sass file:

```scss
@import "node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/all";
```

### Copy GOV.UK Frontend static assets (optional)

GOV.UK Frontend includes the GDS Transport font and some images (like the favicon and the Royal Coat of Arms in the footer). 

You should only use GOV.UK branding and fonts if your service is part of GOV.UK.
See the GOV.UK guidance on [how to brand your service if it's not on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk).

If your app doesn't need these assets, you can skip this step.

By default GOV.UK Frontend expects these assets to be in the `/assets/` path under the server root. You can manually
copy these assets into this folder, but we recommend it's done automatically as part of your build process so that
you always have the latest copy of these files if they change.

For example, if you're using Vite you could use the 
[vite-plugin-static-copy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-static-copy) plugin to automatically copy these 
files.

Install the plugin:

```sh
npm install vite-plugin-static-copy --save-dev
```

In `vite.config.js`, import the plugin:

```js
import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy'
```

and add the following to the `plugins` option:

```js
viteStaticCopy({
  targets: [
    {
      src: 'node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/assets/*',
      dest: 'assets'
    }
  ]
})
```

## Update your HTML template

Some GOV.UK Frontend components expect to be in a container with the `js-enabled` class. The easiest way to ensure this 
is always present is to add it to the `<body>` tag. If you used `create-vue` this will be in `index.html`.

If you're using the [Footer](/components/footer) component, you should also add `govuk-template` to `<html>` and 
`govuk-template__body` to `<body>` to make the grey of the footer extend to the bottom of the page if the page is
shorter than the viewport.

If your service will be branded as GOV.UK you should also add the required `<link>` and `<meta>` tags to set the icons
for various devices:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="govuk-template">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Example GOV.UK Service</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#0b0c0c">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48" href="/assets/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <link rel="mask-icon" href="/assets/images/govuk-mask-icon.svg" color="#0b0c0c">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/assets/images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-180x180.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="167x167" href="/assets/images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-167x167.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/assets/images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-152x152.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/assets/images/govuk-apple-touch-icon.png">
  </head>
  <body class="govuk-template__body js-enabled">
    ...
  </body>
</html>

```

## Use the components

You can now use [GOV.UK Vue components](/components) anywhere in your project. You don't need to import them 
whenever you use them; they're registered globally.

### Check the components and styling work

Use a button to check components are being loaded:

```vue
<gv-button>Hello GOV.UK Vue!</gv-button>
```

You should see a green button. If there's no button at all, check that you've added the plugin to your app with 
`.use(GovUkVue)`. If there's a button but it's not green, check you've `@import`ed the GOV.UK Frontend Sass.

### Check the font and images work (optional)

If you're using the GDS Transport font, check it's working by including a `GvHeader` and checking the
shape of the 'G' in 'GOV.UK':

```vue
<gv-header />
```

If the G has a spur, GDS Transport is working. If there's no spur, it's falling back to Arial.

<img 
src="/assets/images/gds-transport-g-example.png" 
alt="A comparison of uppercase G in GDS Transport and Arial fonts. In GDS Transport it has a spur - a short line extending down from the right of its crossbar. In Arial there is no spur." 
width="334" 
height="203">

If you're using the GOV.UK Frontend images, check they're working by including a `GvFooter` and looking for the
Royal Coat of Arms:

```vue
<gv-footer />
```

## Help, it's not working!
