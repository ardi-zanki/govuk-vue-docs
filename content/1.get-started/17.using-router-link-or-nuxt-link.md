# Using router-link or nuxt-link

Many components in GOV.UK Vue let you pass in a link destination with the `href` prop. Internally, these components
use a normal `<a>` tag and add your `href` to it.

```vue
<gv-back-link href="/" />
```

If you're writing a single-page application (SPA) using [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) or 
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), you probably want to use [router-link](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#router-link) or 
[nuxt-link](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) instead, to avoid a page reload when navigating to a new route.

Every link-based component in GOV.UK Vue lets you change which component is used to render the link. Just import the
component and pass it into the `:component` prop. The `to` prop, and any others you include, will be passed through to
the component you've specified.

```vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import { NuxtLink } from '#components';
</script>

<template>
  <gv-back-link :component="NuxtLink" to="/example-page" />
</template>
```
