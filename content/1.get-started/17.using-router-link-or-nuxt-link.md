# Using router-link or nuxt-link

Many components in GOV.UK Vue let you pass in a link destination with the `href` prop. Internally, these components
use a normal `<a>` tag and add your `href` to it.

```vue
<gv-back-link href="/" />
```

If you're writing a single-page application (SPA) using [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) or 
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), you probably want to use [router-link](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#router-link) or 
[nuxt-link](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) instead, to avoid a page reload when navigating to a new route.

Every link-based component in GOV.UK Vue lets you change which component is used to render the link. Just import the
component and pass it into the `:component` prop. 

For components which take an `href` prop you can use `to` instead, but for components which use a different prop for link URLs, such as 
[Service navigation](/components/service-navigation) and its `service-url` prop, you'll still need to use that prop. These components
pass the URL to the `href` prop of your custom link component, so the component will need to support `href` (`nuxt-link` and `router-link` both do).

```vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import { NuxtLink } from '#components';
</script>

<template>
  <gv-back-link :component="NuxtLink" to="/example-page" />
</template>
```
