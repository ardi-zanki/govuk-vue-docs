# Components

GOV.UK Vue provides Vue components for every component in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/).

You can use these components even if you're not building a government service. See the 
[GOV.UK guidance on using GOV.UK styles in other services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk).

Before you can use these components, you'll need to [install GOV.UK Vue](/get-started/installing-govuk-vue).
